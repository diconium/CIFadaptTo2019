# Creating Actions

### Dependencies

To get started with the instalation of the project make sure you have the following tools:

* Node 10.x or higher.
* NPM or Yarn
* [OpenWhisk CLI](https://openwhisk.apache.org/documentation.html#wsk-cli)
* A configured instance of Adobe I/O Runtime

This demo will serve to show the act of creating an action, the elemental piece of code that is executed in the I/O Runtime instance.

The content of both demos will pass by creating an executable piece of JS code, and then install it manually in I/O using the CLI tool, as well as modify some of their properties.
